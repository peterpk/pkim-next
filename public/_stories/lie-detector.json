        "Finally home from work, rough day. Lots of those, lately. I’m looking forward to my glass of wine.",
        "My son Joey greets me, looks up from his new hobby, a do-it-yourself electronics kit. “Dad! I built a lie detector! Come on Dad, try it.” I take my glass over, grab the two bare wires that my son hands me.",
        "“It’ll buzz if you lie. Say something wrong,” he prompts.",
        "“I’m a green dog,” I lie. BUZZ!",
        "Joey laughs. “It works!”",
        "“Cool,” I mutter, without enthusiasm. BUZZ! Joey gives me a disappointed look. I drop the wires, swig more wine.",
        "“Try again, Dad,” Joey says, shoving the wires at me. “Isn’t this fun?”",
        "“Sure.” BUZZ!",
        "“I like playing together, don’t you?”",
        "With the day and the wine, I barely register what he’s saying. “Yep.” BUZZ!",
        "“I wish Mom could be here. She always loved spending time with me. Loved… me. Don’t you miss her too?”",
        "I’ve been focused on getting through each day, trying not to dwell on her death. “Yeah.” BUZZ! Joey frowns, and now I’m annoyed. “We almost done?”",
        "Joey sits back and looks at me, eyes cold. “It’s done. You failed the test, Dad.” His words finally reach my addled brain. “You failed!” He’s crying. I start to reach out to him, to apologize, but before I can let go of the wires, he pushes one more button. I feel the electricity course up my arms, hit my heart. I feel it stop.",
        "I failed."
