## The Lobsters Dance

> _I wrote this while on summer vacation in Maine, sitting on a hillside overlooking a tiny sheltered cove of the Atlantic Ocean. I wanted to capture a bit of that place and that time._

Every night the lobsters danced. 

There was no quadrille; this is not a silly children&rsquo;s story, after all. It was more of a gentle sway, mimicking the rhythm of the ocean itself. By the moonlight, it was incredibly beautiful. 

The lighthouse keeper had been watching the dances for a week now. He could not really explain why he went to the shore every night. Nor could he really describe how he knew exactly where to find them. He simply walked down to where the rocks met the water, and waited. The lobsters never disappointed him.

Well, just once, they did disappoint him. The one time that the lighthouse keeper&rsquo;s wife joined him, to try to see what he saw, to understand why he went out night after night. That night, the lobsters declined. Of course, she suspected he was going mad. It was almost an occupational hazard; her mother had warned her, so long ago. She had not listened, then, but she was beginning to see it now. 

At first it had seemed romantic. He and she, alone at the edge of the world, with all the majesty of the sea as the backdrop of their life. Over the years, however, there seemed to be more and more backdrop, and less and less life. And now, the lobsters.

She tried to stop him. &ldquo;If you keep up this madness, I may not be here when you come back.&rdquo; She had told him that the past two nights. The past two nights, she had still been there, in their little cottage by the lighthouse. 

Tonight would be different. Tonight she had even packed her bag. &ldquo;I mean it this time,&rdquo; she told his back as he made his way to the door. &ldquo;If you go down there again tonight, I&rsquo;m leaving. My bag is packed. It&rsquo;s your choice.&rdquo;

This time, it seemed, he took notice of her words. He stopped, turning halfway back, looking over his shoulder at her. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come with me? I think the lobsters would dance for you too tonight.&rdquo;

She stared at him for a moment. How could he still persist in this fantasy? She was convinced now. He really had lost any connection he had once had with the real world. Any connection he had with her.

He reached out then with his hand, taking hers into his own. &ldquo;Please,&rdquo; he said, barely more than a whisper. &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo;

She looked down at her hand, trying to remember the last time he had even held her hand. She looked up at his face, entreating her. She put down her bag.

&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; she said shortly. &ldquo;But when there&rsquo;s nothing there, again, still, then I&rsquo;m coming to get my bag, and then I&rsquo;m leaving you here with your lighthouse and your ocean and you&rsquo;re nothing. Nothing except imaginary lobsters.&rdquo;

She walked out the door, brushing past him, taking back her hand. He ran to catch up to her, and they walked down the path, stepped across rocks, and came to the shore. She looked out, arms crossed in front of her, scowling. The ocean ignored her. Nothing danced in front of her eyes.

&ldquo;We&rsquo;re done,&rdquo; she said flatly, not daring to look him in the eyes. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this any more.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Wait. Please. They&rsquo;ll be here. They— yes! They&rsquo;ve come!&rdquo;

At the excitement in his voice she turned, almost despite herself, and looked back to the water. Nothing. As before, as always, there was nothing there.

&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; he said, once more. And again, he took her hand. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re right there.&rdquo; His arm wrapped around her waist, drawing her closer to him.

Could that— ? No. Of course not. But there? As she stood next to her husband, there on the shore, she began to see shapes in the water. Indistinct at first, the lobsters grew more clear the more she watched. There was a purpose to their movement, form and pattern. They did seem like they were swaying with the rhythm of the ocean, as her husband had described. But beyond that, it seemed to her that the lobsters had taken partners. As the partners moved in the dance, the dance revolved around the pairs. Each lobster couple seemed to move independently, in their own unbroken space, while still remaining connected to the dance, and to every other dancer.

This time, she reached out, and took his hand. The lighthouse keeper looked away from the ocean, up at his wife, and broke into a wide smile. &ldquo;You see them now,&rdquo; he breathed.

For a moment she did not answer. Finally she asked, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we ever dance like that?&rdquo;

With his hand still in hers, he reached around and held her. There in the moonlight, by the ocean, they joined the dance.
