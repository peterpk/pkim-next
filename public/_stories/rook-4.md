## Rook-4

> _This story won seventh place in Round 1 of the December 2025 Midnight NYC Microfiction (250 words) contest. The given prompt was that it had to be an action/adventure story, had to include the word &ldquo;live&rdquo;, and had to include the act of flying._
 
&ldquo;Rook 4 to Nest. I have a lock on target. I&rsquo;m going in.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Copy, Rook 4. Good luck.&rdquo;

Jay breathed in, adjusted his wings, and dove. This was a simple extraction: acquire the item, deliver it to the Nest. Jay was a veteran of dozens of similar missions. No reason for today to be any—

&ldquo;Rook 4, abort! Guardian advancing!&rdquo;

From the corner of one eye, Jay spotted the enemy. Twice his size, head to toe in black, and – dammit! – so fast. Jay banked as it attacked, coming within a feather&rsquo;s width of his tail. He perched on a branch, considering his options.

&ldquo;Rook 4, status!&rdquo;

&ldquo;No damage. Re-evaluating my approach.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Negative! Too dangerous. Return to Nest. Live to fly another day.&rdquo;

Jay considered that for as long as it took to pick a nit. 

No retreat. 

This was for the children. More importantly, Raven was waiting – he couldn&rsquo;t let her down.

Jay watched the Guardian circle and lay down in a patch of sunshine, seemingly asleep. He wasn&rsquo;t fooled. But… there! Jay dropped to the ground and grabbed a stray acorn. He shot back up, past the Guardian, and as expected, it lunged after him. Jay tossed the acorn away and turned away while the enemy paused, looking towards the clattering noise. That was enough: Jay dove faster than ever, grabbed the shiny string, and soared to Nest.

At the window, Joe watched the scene unfold. &ldquo;Maud, a magpie stole the cat&rsquo;s ribbon! What a birdbrain…"
