**Case Report**

_Background_: Patient is male, indeterminate age, living alone in a small flat. Poor living conditions marked by uneaten food and unwashed dishes littering all surfaces. Pet cat in poor health, undernourished, fur disappearing in patches. Patient operates a millinery business in the capital, albeit his lack of focus (e.g. obsession with tea, habitually late for sessions despite several reprimands) limits his success. No social interactions have been observed, though he claims to have a few good friends (but see below). Patient described maternal abuse as a child, including beatings, neglect, and being raised alongside pigs. 

_Presentation_: Patient claims his closest companions are a mouse and two rabbits. No sense of passage of time. Clear OCD symptoms manifesting as a mania for clean dishware, paired with avolition so that no actual washing gets done.

Crisis event involved a hallucination of an otherworldly young girl leading him into antisocial and self-destructive behaviors, ranging from larceny to assault to substance abuse (hard drinking, edibles). Patient insists all of the actions were performed by the fantasy girl, and he is merely relaying the story; this projection is patently an escape from confronting the reality of his actions.

_Conclusions_: Observations lead to diagnosis of bipolar psychosis. Patient was initially remanded for study as a potential threat to Her Majesty’s safety, after an incident in the Red Court, but no violent tendencies have been noted – the incident with the jabberwock notwithstanding. 

_Recommendation_: Patient should continue treatment at Royal Hearts Hospital for the foreseeable future. In addition to standard pharmaceutical cakes, patient requires intensive rehabilitation to deconstruct his fantasy world in which animals have no voices, books are written without pictures, and young girls can be bored by everyday events. Looking-glass therapy is scheduled to begin tomorrow.
