## Elixir

Accept the elixir \
From the madwoman in the wood. \
She instructs you: \
Focus, \
picture yourself as \
your chosen animal. \
She is still speaking \
but you do not hear her warnings. \
Instead you feel \
your wings spread wide, \
currents of air flowing, \
dancing in your feathers, \
over, under, \
lifting you further above \
the everyday. \
The world you flee, \
insignificant from such a height, \
yet filling your view, \
spread out so wide, \
like wings. \
Again the crone&rsquo;s voice \
interrupts: \
&ldquo;Not too long! Never tarry! \
Or you forget! \
You forget you are human!&rdquo; 

You forget you are human.

You fly on.
