## Lie Detector Test

> _This story won first place in Round 1 of the December 2021 Midnight NYC Microfiction (250 words) contest. The given prompt was that it had to be a horror story, had to include the word 'wine', and had to include the act of taking a lie detector test._
 
Finally home from work, rough day. Lots of those, lately. I&rsquo;m looking forward to my glass of wine.

My son Joey greets me, looks up from his new hobby, a do-it-yourself electronics kit. &ldquo;Dad! I built a lie detector! Come on Dad, try it.&rdquo; I take my glass over, grab the two bare wires that my son hands me.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll buzz if you lie. Say something wrong,&rdquo; he prompts.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a green dog,&rdquo; I lie. BUZZ!

Joey laughs. &ldquo;It works!&rdquo;

&ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; I mutter, without enthusiasm. BUZZ! Joey gives me a disappointed look. I drop the wires, swig more wine.

&ldquo;Try again, Dad,&rdquo; Joey says, shoving the wires at me. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this fun?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; BUZZ!

&ldquo;I like playing together, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;

With the day and the wine, I barely register what he&rsquo;s saying. &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; BUZZ!

&ldquo;I wish Mom could be here. She always loved spending time with me. Loved… me. Don&rsquo;t you miss her too?&rdquo;

I&rsquo;ve been focused on getting through each day, trying not to dwell on her death. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; BUZZ! Joey frowns, and now I&rsquo;m annoyed. &ldquo;We almost done?&rdquo;

Joey sits back and looks at me, eyes cold. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done. You failed the test, Dad.&rdquo; His words finally reach my addled brain. &ldquo;You failed!&rdquo; He&rsquo;s crying. I start to reach out to him, to apologize, but before I can let go of the wires, he pushes one more button. I feel the electricity course up my arms, hit my heart. I feel it stop.

I failed.
