Options included cloning the application so that the divestiture had its own copy, using the application in place and logically segregating divestiture and company data, or not allowing the divestiture to use the application at all. This was done in concert with a 'lift and shift' of applications from on-prem hosting to a new public cloud VPC, as shown."
